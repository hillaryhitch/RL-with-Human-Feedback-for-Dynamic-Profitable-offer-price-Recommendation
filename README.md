#SUMMARY:

This is a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize product price recommendation for multiple customer segments based on: 
    
    1. Customer response (buy /no buy)
    
    2. COPCAR (minimum acceptable customer price)
    
    3. Human feedback loop for when customer has no buy
    
The 3 points basically mean:
    
The algorithm uses a Q-learning with an epsilon-greedy policy to learn the optimal prices for a set of products based on customer preferences. 
In addition, the algorithm incorporates human feedback to improve its performance by asking customers if they would accept a higher price for a product if they did not buy it at the current price.

The repository includes the following files:

1. RLHF.ipynb: A notebook with the code and simulation.

2. README.md: a detailed description of the algorithm and how to run the code.

3. requirements.txt: a list of Python packages required to run the code.


To run the code, users can simply execute the RLHF notebook script and follow the instructions provided. 
The script generates output that shows the product prices, rewards, and whether the customers buy the products at the given prices. 
The Q-values for each state-action pair are also updated based on the observed rewards and human feedback.
